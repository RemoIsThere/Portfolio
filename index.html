          <h4>HomeGenie</h4>
          <p>HomeGenie is a user-friendly IoT based platform to connect all your IoT devices of your home so that you can control them from anywhere, as long as you have a proper internet connection for both your IoT devices and the device you are using HomeGenie with. The catch is, you dont even need to download any external application or software as it works on the browser. You can even give the voice commands like "Turn on the fan" or "Turn off the lights" and the IoT device will act accordingly.</p>

          <h4>URide</h4>
          <p>Uride is a user-friendly platform specifically made for Chitkara students for their travelling issues. One of the biggest issues in the college was transportation. Some students come by their vehicles, some use public transport and other uses college transport. This inconsistency can be a big trouble when we look into factors like expenses, timings and most of all, hygiene. So our team came up with a project which can store the data of the day-scholars who can be labeled as "drivers" and "passengers". The students who come with their own vehicles can give a ride to the others just like popular services like Bla-Bla and Uber. Through this platform, students can easily choose their ride as a passenger and can further safely pay via razorpay (or cash)  to the drivers. We have added a user-friendly map marking all the nearby locations of the university for easy access.</p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>
      As of my work experience, I have experience of 2 years for Front-end Development.
      For UI/UX designing, I have recently shown interest in this and am currently learning it more and more by the time. <br>
      I feel like i can make a good UI/UX design with the time given. <br><br>
      Professionally, I have been a social enterpeneur in the NGO- <a href="https://hamaripahchan.org/">Hamari Pahchan</a>.
